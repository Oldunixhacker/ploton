# Ploton UI

Firefox's Proton UI is great:

* Icon to remind you of Microsoft Edge
* Simple user interface
* Almost fits the Windows 11 user interface

but there are some flaws:

* Is it a tab or a button?
* No icons
* Harder to see the highlight colors on tabs

This Firefox theme addresses the issue.

## Optional features

These can be enabled in `about:config`.

* **Photon-styled tabs** `ploton.photonTabs`
  
  Ploton by default modifies Proton's tab look to remove bottom curves and replace them with
  a Chromium-like style. You can make it actually replicate tabs used in Photon by enabling
  this boolean option.

* **Icons** `ploton.menuIcons`
  
  Enable icons like Photon's interface.

* **GTK icon scheme (Linux)** `ploton.systemIcons`
  
  Inspired by the Firefox GNOME theme's option to use GTK's icon scheme. Use the system icon
  scheme.
